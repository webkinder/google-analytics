Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager for WordPress without tracking your own visits.

== Description ==

Deploy Google Analytics on your website without having to edit code and without tracking your own visits. You can exclude any logged in user from this and enable tracking solely for them. You can also ignore a device by ticking a box which sets a session cookie.

You can also enter your Google Tag Manager ID and disable tracking via GTM.

We would love to hear your [feedback](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wk-google-analytics/reviews/). It helps us improve and expand the plugin according to your needs.
